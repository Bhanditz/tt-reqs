# TTML2 2nd Edition Requirements

[Latest Draft](https://w3c.github.io/tt-reqs/ttml2-2e-reqs/)

# Proposed Requirement Description Files

Detailed proposals for a set of related requirements for TTML2 2e (beyond merely filing an issue) should take the form of a github markdown file, placed in the ``proposed`` directory. See ``proposed/template.md`` for a template for creating such a file.

The names of proposed requirement files should take the form ``req-000-shortname``, where the digits (``000``) are replaced with a (zero-filled) issue number that introduces the (related) requirements, and where ``shortname`` is replaced with (one or more hyphen separated) tokens. For example, ``req-002-css-styling``, ``req-003-live``, ``req-004-adpt``, etc.
